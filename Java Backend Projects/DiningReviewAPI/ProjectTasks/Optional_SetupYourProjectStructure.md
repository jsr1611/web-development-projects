## Optional: Setup your project structure

It can be helpful to organize your project source files. Whether and how you choose to do so is completely up to you, and it will depend on your project’s complexity. The main guidance is to keep your main application class in the root package above the other classes. For Spring’s best practice on structuring your code, see [this Spring documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using.html#using.structuring-your-code).

The Spring Initializr-generated project will not have any subpackage folders defined. Locate the project folder containing the main application java file and create your desired subfolders within there.
