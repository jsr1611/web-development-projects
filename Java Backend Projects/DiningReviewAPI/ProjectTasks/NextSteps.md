## Next steps
Think of how you might expand the API scenarios beyond the ones in these project tasks. You can also try building a client-side app experience that would talk to your APIs. Get creative!

## Next Steps
Congrats! What’s next?

Congratulations on completing the Skill Path! Now that you have finished your learning journey, you may be asking, “What’s next?” Here are our recommendations for next steps:

### Web UIs with HTML, CSS, and Thymeleaf
We’ve covered back-end Spring applications, which return JSON in their responses. You can turn your apps into full-stack applications by using the Model - View - Controller (MVC) pattern and sending web pages, rather than JSON, in responses. Read [our article on MVC](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/mvc), take our [Learn HTML course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), then our [Learn CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css), and then move on to [Spring’s templating engine, Thymeleaf](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/).

### Exception Handling and Logging
Applications should handle errors gracefully and informatively. Use this [Spring blog post](https://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc) to get started.

### Security
An app isn’t useful if it isn’t secure. Only known users with granted permissions should be able to access your application, in a process known as authentication and authorization. This is a whole domain of its own, but you can get started implementing some authentication with this [Securing a Web Application guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/).

### Deployment and Cloud Services
Get your apps off your computer and into the virtual world! Deployment refers to any process in which you make your app accessible to users. There are plenty of cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform, that specialize in deployment. To explore Azure, for example, start off with this [Azure deployment tutorial on spring.io](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot-for-azure/), then dig into the [Azure Spring Cloud website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/spring-cloud/). For AWS, use the [Getting started with Spring Boot on AWS blog series](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/getting-started-with-spring-boot-on-aws-part-1/). For Google, start with the [Build, containerize, and deploy Spring Boot apps on Google Cloud pathway](https://developers.google.com/learn/pathways/java-cloud-fundamentals).

Once again, congratulations on finishing your Skill Path! We’re excited to see what you accomplish next.
