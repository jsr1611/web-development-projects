## Use Lombok to help implement entities
In a different task, you had to define a POJO class to represent a restaurant. You normally would have to define both the constructors as well as any setters and getters for the individual properties. Lombok helps you save yourself from having to write all that code. Instead, you apply specific Lombok annotations that will auto-generate that code for you.

Apply the appropriate Lombok annotations that will auto-generate the constructors, getters and setters for your restaurant entity class.
