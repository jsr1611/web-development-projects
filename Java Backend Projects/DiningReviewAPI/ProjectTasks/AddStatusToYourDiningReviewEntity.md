## Add “status” to your dining review entity

In a different task, we introduced the administrator scenario where the admin will need to approve or reject a user’s submission. You will need to represent that status as part of the dining review. That way, you will be able to determine which dining reviews are pending, and which ones have already been accepted or rejected.

Extend your existing dining review entity to include this notion of status.
