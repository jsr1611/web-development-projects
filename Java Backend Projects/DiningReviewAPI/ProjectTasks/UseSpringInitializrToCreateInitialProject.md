## Use Spring Initialzr to create the initial project

Go to start.spring.io and configure a Maven project targeting Java that includes the following dependencies:

- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 Database
- Lombok

Note the Java version that’s been pre-selected and be sure to install that [corresponding JDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) if you haven’t already.

Configure the Project Metadata as you wish. Accept the remaining defaults and click Generate. You will have a .zip file. Unzip the contents to a local folder.
