## Overview

For this project, you will build an application using everything you’ve learned so far. 
You’ll start from scratch and finish with a working API of your own. 
This is your chance to showcase your skills to potential employers and teammates!

We’ve provided the high-level tasks to complete this project, 
which includes a few new techniques you may have to research on your own. 
If you’d like to challenge yourself even further, keep building! 
This project can be extended in a variety of ways as you learn more Spring concepts.

## Project Objectives

- Construct a RESTful web API with data persistence using Spring and Spring Data JPA
- Use Spring Initializr to generate the initial Java project
- Configure application properties for certain dependencies, including the H2 embedded database
- Define the entities that comprise this application scenario
- Define the repositories that enable creating, updating, and querying these different entities
- Define the API contracts that will enable this application scenario
- Leverage the convenience of Lombok
- Use cURL to test your API scenarios

## Setup

### Going off platform:
You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on your own computer.

For this project, you will be using your own IDE. See the [Spring Project Layout and Running Locally article](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/create-rest-apis-with-spring-and-java/tracks/spring-apis-web-and-spring-basics/modules/how-spring-works/articles/spring-project-layout-and-running-locally).

### Debugging Tips
Feeling stuck? Try the following:

- Google your question: oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! 
Check out websites like StackOverflow and Dev.to to see how other folks have found solutions.
- Read the documentation: make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any languages 
and libraries that you are using. Oftentimes they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
- Rubber ducking: try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. 
Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain it.
And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.
